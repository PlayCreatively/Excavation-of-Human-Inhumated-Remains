- Gotland is famous for its calcareous (limestone) soil. It means bone preservation is often excellent, unlike the acidic soils in much of mainland Sweden which dissolve bone.

### Exposure: "Digging" without Disturbing

*   **Tools:**
    *   **Trowel:** For removing the bulk of the soil *above* the skeleton.
    *   **Wooden/Plastic tools (or spoons):** Used when getting close to bone to avoid scratching it.
    *   **Brushes:** For sweeping away loose dirt.
    *   **Dentist picks:** For fine detail (cleaning eye sockets, between ribs).

*   **Technique:**
    *   **Work horizontally:** Excavate in thin, even layers (spits) of 2–5 cm. Never dig straight down blindly.
    *   **"Pedestalling" (Avoid this!):** A common rookie mistake is digging around a bone until it sits on a little tower of dirt. This makes it unstable. *Correct method:* Keep the bone supported by dirt underneath it until you are ready to lift.
    *   **Order of Exposure:** Usually, you expose the **skull and major long bones** first to understand the position. You often leave the **hands, feet, and face** for last because they are fragile and complex (many small bones).

### Grave Depth

![[Pasted image 20260130160316.png]]

- Do old graves tend to be shallow?
### Skeleton resting position *(is important)*

- Needs to be deducted while digging
  **question**: why? To know how to dig around it?
- The position reveals various things such as:
	- Supine (on back): Christian/common.
	- Prone (face down): Deviant burial, execution, or disrespect.
	- Crouched/Fetal: Prehistoric/Iron Age (common on Gotland)

- Skeleton form gets flat over time?
  *might be very hard to implement*

### Degradation
#### Clothing

- **Science:** Clothing tend to be eaten up by **bacteria**.
- **Science:** When bronze or copper corrodes, it releases toxic metal salts. These salts kill the bacteria that usually eat fabric.
- **Evidence:** If the body was wearing a bronze brooch (jewelry) or a belt buckle, the small patch of fabric directly touching that metal will be preserved.

### Lifting / bagging

- **Order:** Generally, lift from the **Skull down to the Feet**.
- **The Golden Rule of Bagging:** **Left and Right must be separated.**
    - Right Hand bones go in a bag marked "Right Hand."
    - Left Hand bones go in a bag marked "Left Hand."
    - Why? Sorting 50 tiny finger bones in the lab is a nightmare if they are mixed.
- **Ribs:** often bagged as "Right Ribs" and "Left Ribs."

### Grave dating

There are numerous ways of dating a grave:
	**Scenario:**  
	You find a coin minted in **1750** inside the grave.
	**Logic:**
	1. **Fact:** That coin did not exist in the world until 1750.
	2. **Fact:** Therefore, this grave cannot have been dug earlier than 1750.
	3. **Conclusion:** The grave must be from **1750 or later.**

> Rural contexts may contain isolated or small clusters of burials, especially from
> the late Iron Age and Roman periods, as well as larger burial grounds, such as
> Anglo-Saxon cemeteries. In the case of an isolated burial, it may difficult to
> identify what the feature is until it is fully excavated, so care should be taken
> with all unidentified features. Some clues may exist: burials of this nature tend
> to be subrectangular in shape, located outside the main focus of domestic
> activity and may be aligned on a north-south or east-west axis. Small clusters of
> burials may be located in enclosures within field systems. However, it is not
> uncommon to find burials inserted into features initially dug or made for other
> purposes, especially during the Iron Age and Romano-British Periods. For
> example, bodies have been deposited in ditches, graves have been cut into
> banks and the remains of neonates have been found under floor layers and in
> postholes. In these cases, the location of skeletal remains may, on first
> impressions, appear to be random and can, therefore, be unpredictable. 

> Some burials also have been found to contain individuals whose heads have
> been removed from their bodies • not infrequently skeletons dating to the
> Roman period, for example, have been found with the skull placed between the
> legs. Often, bones aren't quite where you were expecting them to be!
> Many burials are found with grave goods, which require careful excavation as
> they may be very fragile. Also, the recording of the location of these goods in
> relation to the grave cut and the body is important. Some of the grave goods
> may contain articulated animal bones, possibly representing the remnants of
> food offerings given to the dead. The position of these should also be recorded
> carefully to distinguish them from other animal bones that are unintentionally
> included or intrusive in the grave back-fill. If you are unfamiliar with animal and
> human bone and are not confident about differentiating between the two, either
> ask your on-site osteoarcheologist to help or record and recover any bone you
> suspect may be useful for interpretation of the feature, as you would do
> normally. As long as the location of bones are recorded properly,
> post-excavation analysis should clarify the information presented.

**Some great points:**
- the placement of items in burial is important.
- may include extra bones, sometimes due to food offerings.

### Grave back-filling
Grave back-filling is the process of refilling an excavated grave with the previously removed soil to ensure proper closure, ground stability, and safety. The soil is usually returned in layers and compacted to prevent future sinking (settling) or erosion, often with a final mounded layer to allow for further settling. 

**Key Considerations for Proper Grave Back-filling:**

- **Layered Compaction:** Soil should be replaced in 15cm to 20cm layers, with each layer compacted to prevent future settling.
- **Material Quality:** The excavated soil should be free of large debris, rocks, and, in some cases, excessive clay, which can hinder proper compaction.
- **Drainage:** Proper compaction helps ensure that water does not pool in the hole.
- **Mounding:** It is common to create a slight mound of earth over the grave to compensate for the settling that will occur over time.

### Tools Inventory

- **Mattock:** Used to break up hard, compacted ground or turf.
- **Spade (Pointed):** For digging into the ground
- **Trowel (Specifically a WHS 4-inch Pointing Trowel):** The holy grail of tools. It is used to scrape the soil horizontally (not digging holes).

### Ludemes

- **Ludeme:** You're always working on the same site.
- **Result:** 
	- Gives a sense of progression as you uncover more skeletons and artifacts.
	- Drives home the permanence of mistakes—one wrong move can damage irreplaceable finds. As well as exemplifying the destructive nature of archaeology. (procedural rhetoric element)
	- Over time, you develop a deeper understanding of the site's history and cultural practices. (puzzle/detective element)

- **Ludeme:** Chronic night-time
	- Affords a small cozy shed for all tools and findings. Always taking place at night, requiring manual light placement, resulting in deep atmosphere and subtle spooks. (mood/aesthetics/cozy/creepy/game story element)
	- Ambient sounds of digging, brushes, and distant wildlife enhance immersion. (mood/aesthetics/cozy/creepy/game story element)

- **Ludeme:** You need to find the back-fill lining.

- **Ludeme:** (Return of the Obra Dinn + Tickets, please)-style deduction
	- Don't get confirmation of making a right assessment until you've got **X** amount right.
	- Need to link facts from the guide/book to write record facts.

- **Ludeme:** Types of graves
	- **typical grave**
	- **cenotaph** *(a memorial to the deceased whose body isn't present)*
		- ✔️ tombstone.
		- ❌ back-fill boundary.
		- ❌ skeleton.
	  [Player] removes grass layer and but doesn't see any **grave-fill boundary**.
	- **clandestine graves** 👀 *(unlawful burial sites containing human remains)*
		- ❌ tombstone.
		- ✔️ back-fill boundary.
		- ✔️ skeleton. Probably prone *(face down)*.
	- **dissolved bones** (some soil can be acidic and leave no trace)
		- ✔️ tombstone.
		- ✔️ back-fill boundary.
		- ❌ skeleton.
	  a **silhouette** of the body may be observable in the form of a **shadow**/**dark stain** in the soil.

#### Key aspects of grave-fill boundaries include:
- **Detection Methods:** Geophysical techniques like Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) are most effective at detecting these boundaries, as they can identify differences in soil density, moisture, and compaction between the fill and the surrounding ground.
- **Physical Characteristics:** The fill within a grave is typically less dense than the surrounding soil, which often results in higher moisture content.
- **Soil Composition:** The fill is composed of a mixture of the original soil excavated to make the grave.
- **Archaeological Evidence:** In archaeological contexts, the fill is often identified by changes in soil color or texture, indicating that the soil has been previously disturbed.
- **Process:** During excavation, the boundary is identified as the edge of the pit, and maintaining the integrity of this wall is essential for proper stratigraphic recording.

### Player agency and expression

We need to be very conscious of the conflict between player agency/expression and the educational goals of the game. A bit of leeway in player choice will enhance engagement, therefore, evaluating *when* to allow this, and to dutifully inform the player of each case, is important.


### Art style

- realistic human bones
